# Abstract
Most of the houses in a city or town get their water supply from their particular City
Corporation or Water Board. The majority of the areas in a city have a water supply
is planned as per the schedule. The people living in such regions manage their water
usage according to the program and have to note down the next date for their water
supply manually.
In some circumstances, such as technical difficulties with the reservoir or the water
board, a sector may not get the water supply on the expected day, which might lead
the household people not getting water in time and create much commotion due to
confusion. Our proposed system tries to automate this process by informing the users
on what day their particular sector will get the water supply.
If there are any delays to a specific region, administrators can update the water
supply date accordingly in the database. In addition to this, the user can also check
out his water bill information and can also get the contact information of their
sectorâ€™s water supply contractor. Thus, our proposed system will act as a one-stop
solution to all the water supply problems of a household and help society.

# Motivation
The main encouraging factor for creating the application was to give the citizens of Belagavi
city easy and reliable access to their water supply details. The necessity of designing this
application is to let the citizens of a ward know when they are getting their water supply and if
there is any delay in the normal schedule of the water supply. This helps the citizens to manage
their stored water efficiently and also reduces the wastage of water. When it comes to paying
the water bills, the citizens have to either pay their bills at the Government Organizations such
as KarnatakaOne or the water supply officers have to collect the bill payment manually by
visiting the houses of the citizens. This application pools all of the actions mentioned above to
one application which will produce accurate results for every individual with no errors.
