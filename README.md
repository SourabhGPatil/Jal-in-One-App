# Abstract
Most of the houses in a city or town get their water supply from their particular City
Corporation or Water Board. The majority of the areas in a city have a water supply
is planned as per the schedule. The people living in such regions manage their water
usage according to the program and have to note down the next date for their water
supply manually.
In some circumstances, such as technical difficulties with the reservoir or the water
board, a sector may not get the water supply on the expected day, which might lead
the household people not getting water in time and create much commotion due to
confusion. Our proposed system tries to automate this process by informing the users
on what day their particular sector will get the water supply.
If there are any delays to a specific region, administrators can update the water
supply date accordingly in the database. In addition to this, the user can also check
out his water bill information and can also get the contact information of their
sector’s water supply contractor. Thus, our proposed system will act as a one-stop
solution to all the water supply problems of a household and help society.

# Motivation
The main encouraging factor for creating the application was to give the citizens of Belagavi
city easy and reliable access to their water supply details. The necessity of designing this
application is to let the citizens of a ward know when they are getting their water supply and if
there is any delay in the normal schedule of the water supply. This helps the citizens to manage
their stored water efficiently and also reduces the wastage of water. When it comes to paying
the water bills, the citizens have to either pay their bills at the Government Organizations such
as KarnatakaOne or the water supply officers have to collect the bill payment manually by
visiting the houses of the citizens. This application pools all of the actions mentioned above to
one application which will produce accurate results for every individual with no errors.

# Existing System
The water distribution system depends on the local natural resources available, and its efficiency
is measured by how well it can satisfy the city's needs. The city's corporation maintains a proper
water supply timetable so that every region of the city gets an adequate water supply. In
circumstances where the water supply schedule is changed, the information to the public is not
conveyed properly. Generally, it is conveyed via the newspaper or by local News channels. For
this system to work people have to be up to date with the regular changes in the neighborhood and
be in sync with newspapers and TV channels. This is a good practice but however, but there may
arise some circumstances where you aren’t in contact with these details therefore it becomes rather
a bothersome task.

## Problems with the existing system
In a city like Belgaum, the majority of the areas yet don’t have a 24-hour water supply. These
areas usually get the water supply after 2 to 7 days, depending on situations. Here are some of the
problems we found out after surveying in such areas –
PROBLEM NO.01 –
The citizens living in the areas that don’t have a 24 hours water supply need to manually note
down in their calendars or remember what day they are getting the water supply.
PROBLEM NO.02 –
In some cases, due to some technical difficulties with water supply, an area may not get the water
supply on the supposed day and time. It may be challenging to convey the water supply delay to
the citizens quickly. This problem disrupts the stored water management of a household as they
may not be prepared for the delay in the water supply.
PROBLEM NO.03 –
Due to these irregularities in the water supply timing, people usually store excessive water for
their households. If this water is not used, the people throw away this water, thus resulting in
water wastage.
PROBLEM NO.04 –
If there are any grievances from the user regarding the water supply or if they want to give any
feedback to the area’s Water Supply Officer, then the citizen has to search for his contact
information as he/she might not have his contact number.
PROBLEM NO.05 –
The water board officers/employees have to visit the areas of the city to issue the water bill to
each household and collect it. This analogue system of collecting bills is inefficient.

# Objectives of the project
The main aim of this project is to provide an application that will act as the one-stop solution to
all the water supply problems of a household and help the society as a whole to conserve water.
This project will be very useful in remote areas on India that are yet not having a 24 hours water
supply and are dependent on their local water body for the supply of drinking water.
The objectives of the project are:
➢ Notify the users on what day and time their particular sector is getting the drinking water
supply.
➢ Notify the users if there are any delays in the water supply.
➢ Provide an interface for the users to check their water bill and also notify them about the bill’s
due date.
➢ Ease in accessing the contact information of a sector’s water supply contractor/officer.
➢ Reduce the dependency on the traditional way of paying the water bill by digitalizing the
process.
